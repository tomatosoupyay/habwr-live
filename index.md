# HABWR Live data website
HABWR is an abbreviation for Hoshizora Advanced Boiling Water Reactor, one of the few functioning boiling water reactors in stormworks.
Boiling water reactors deliver higher efficiency than the traditional stormworks PWR. Something akin to 'a little bit more i think'
There are three proposed HABWR sites, with only one that exists as of late.

## Live data
### Site 1:
Electrical Output: **2,500**KSW
Thermal power: **100**%
Reactor pressure: **1,215**Kpa
Radiation in containment: **0.01**RU
Radiation in environment: **0**RU
-# Environmental radiation is measured at the vent stack.
-# RU is the standard Stormworks radiation unit.
